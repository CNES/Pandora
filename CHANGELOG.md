### Added

- Implementation of a state machine for Pandora's sequencing management. [#107]
- Disparity grids as input to define dmin and dmax values for each pixel. [#91]
- A changelog file. [#115]

### Changed

- "Image configuration (no data of image, no data and invalid pixel of input mask ) is now
  implemented as attributes of xarray image dataset and must no longer be provided separately to the run method. [#131]
- The reference/secondary naming convention becomes left/right naming. [#135]
- Functions which can modify input arguments passed by reference does not return these references anymore. [#109]
