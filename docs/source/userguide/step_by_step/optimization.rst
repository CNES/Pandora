Optimization
============

Theoretical basics
------------------

The third step is to minimize a global energy defined by

    :math:`E(d) = E_{data}(d) + \lambda E_{smooth}(d)`

First term, called data term represents raw matching cost measurement. The right one, the smoothness term, represents smoothness assumptions made
by the algorithm.

The methods available in Pandora are

- Semi-Global Matching [Hirschmuller2007]_, made available by :ref:`plugin_libsgm`.

Configuration and parameters
