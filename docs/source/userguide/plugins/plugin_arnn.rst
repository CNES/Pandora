Plugin ARNN
===========

Theoretical basics
******************

`Pandora plugin <https://github.com/CNES/Pandora_plugin_arnn>`_ to compute buildings semantic segmentation.

**Goals**

The segmentation computed in [Dumas2022ARNN]_ uses a Convolutional Neural Network. The chosen neural network architecture (LinkNet) only takes
RGB as input channels. Hence we can assume it will try to detect building pixels mainly based on roof and neighborhood colors.

To prevent he network to entirely miss buildings of unseen architecture we use interactive learning
following the DISCA workflow [Lenczner2020]_ to refine the initial neural network (INN) and with it, its predictions.
Here, annotations are manual clicks provided by an operator. To remove the need for a human-in-the-loop we propose to automate the annotation process

**Automatic annotations method**

A customizable disparity threshold is applied to a disparity map computed from a DSI that has yet to be optimized. The threshold helps differentiate between ground and roof pixels.
Disparities above the threshold are translated to building annotations. We then filter the building annotations to remove false positive on high vegetation areas using
a simple vegetation mask computed from the left epipolar image.
