#  Temporarily disabling hooks Â¶

# Not all hooks are perfect so sometimes you may need to skip execution of one or more hooks. pre-commit solves this by querying a SKIP environment variable. The SKIP environment variable is a comma separated list of hook ids. This allows you to skip a single hook instead of --no-verifying the entire commit.

# $ SKIP=flake8 git commit -m "foo"
